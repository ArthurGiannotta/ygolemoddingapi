# Yu-Gi-Oh! LotD LE Modding API
An API that enables multiple functionalities in Yu-Gi-Oh! Legacy of the Duelist Link Evolution: adding missing cards, expanding the limits on new characters and new duels and creating injectable plugins.

For now, it is in Alpha stage, where users are allowed to test stuff and report bugs. Refer to the Wiki for more information (https://github.com/ArthurGiannotta/ygolemoddingapi/wiki).
